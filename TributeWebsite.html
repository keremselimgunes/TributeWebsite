        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit from the Shire, who embarks on a grand adventure in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, "The Hobbit." He begins as a quiet and unassuming character but grows into a brave and resourceful hero. His journey is one of self-discovery, courage, and friendship. Along the way, he encounters trolls, goblins, elves, and the dragon Smaug, all of which challenge him in unexpected ways.</p>
        <p>Bilbo's courage and cleverness make him a beloved character in Tolkien's Middle-earth. His role in finding the One Ring sets the stage for the epic events of "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, where he passes on the Ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins.</p>
